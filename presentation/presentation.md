<h2 class="slide-title">Specification workshop</h2>


- Sometimes called Discovery Workshop or 3 amigos
  - A diverse group having conversations to clarify and confirm the acceptance criteria of a user story
  
  <!--- Participants
    - A programmer, who thinks about how to make things, says what is feasable, suggests simpler paths
    - A tester, who thinks about how to break things, and come up with lots of scenarios, sometimes covering obscure edge cases, and sometimes covery very important ones 
    - The product owner, who cares about scope
    - Anybody relevant to the story being discussed (operations, UX designer...)-->

  - Output:
    - A set of concrete examples to illustrate each business rules, which will be automated

  - Tips to make it work:
    - Invite a programmer, a tester the product owner, and whoever is relevant to the story being discussed (operations, UX designer...)
    - Write examples in natural language (avoid the the given/when/then structure)
    - Keep Discovery Workshops short and frequent (every other day). 15 min. per story, as often as you can
    - Don't make it a big ceremony, just ask for examples

  - Effective way to get a shared understanding of what Done means for a story, to discover unknown unknowns, and find alternative paths.

# Writing acceptance criterias

THIS WILL MORE CONCRETE IF WE CAN SPEAK FROM THE EXAMPLES WE JUST CRAFTED.


## Illustrate user stories with key examples

Key examples help to see the big picture

it is far better to focus on illustrating user stories with key examples.

Key examples are a small number of relatively simple scenarios that are easy to understand, evaluate for completeness and critique.

If there are too many rules, break them down into several groups of smaller examples

Several simple groups of key examples are much easier to understand and implement than a huge list of complex scenarios.

Overly complex examples, or too many examples, are often a sign that some important business concepts are not explicitly described.


## contrast key examples with counter-examples


In general, we should use a set of counter-examples for each key example, where each counter-example highlights a different contributing factor or parameter that affects the rule.


### How to make it work

- Start with the simplest key example
  - Always prefer actual values over generalisations unless the value is irrelevant to the rule.
- Underline the parts of the example that are most relevant to the feature or rule. Make sure you distinguish between inputs and outputs.



## describe what, not how

## Use actual values instead Avoid mathematical formulas



## one test, one topic

Independent tests for different actions are much easier to maintain than one overall test that validates everything.
Independent tests also allow faster feedback.

# prefer smaller tables
# look for hidden concepts

<h2 class="slide-title">Page object pattern</h2>

<p class="mt-4 fragment">Page objects abstract away the DOM manipulation from the test code</p>

```

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<p class="text-level-2 apart fragment">Selectors based on <code>data-testid</code> are <strong>more efficient</strong> and<br> <strong>more robust to changes</strong></p>


Note:

The data-cy attribute will not change from CSS style or JS behavioral changes, meaning it's not coupled to the behavior or styling of an element.
Don't test it if it's not testable

<h2 class="slide-title">Wait for events, not time</h2>


<h3 class="fragment">When can I verify the result of async operations?</h3>

```typescript

cy.wait(2000)  // wait for 2 seconds

// Good
cy.intercept("POST", "/api/basket/add-product").as("addProductToBasket")
cy.wait("@addProductToBasket")  // wait for a http response

// Good
cy.contains("Welcome")  // wait for the page to contain "welcome"

Note:

<h2 class="slide-title">Minimize UI interrections</h2>


<p class="mt-5 fragment">Try to <strong>avoid the UI</strong> for all the parts of the tests <br> not dealing with <strong>UI-specific risks</strong>

<p class="mt-2 fragment">Setup your tests through <strong>api</strong>, <strong>db access</strong>...

<p class="mt-5 fragment">No UI set-up is <strong>faster</strong> and <strong>easier to maintain</strong>

Note:

From 50 quick ideas...
By avoiding the UI layer where it is not actually relevant for the purpose of the test, teams can save a lot of troubleshooting time and speed up feedback, while still keeping the same level of risk coverage.

Even when tests need to execute through the UI, minimise the part of the test that actually simulates user actions. Evaluate which parts of the tests are actually dealing with UI-specific risks, and try to automate everything else by avoiding the UI.

Set-up and clean-up tasks serve to make tests reliable and repeatable, but they do not actually deal with the user interface risk (or, more precisely, they should not ‚Äì if a set-up task is testing things, it should be broken into several tests).

Notes:
The Acceptance tests comes out of acceptance criterias.
Thinking about tests before development is more efficient:
 - the developer and the tester are aligned on the scope of the change
 - the developer writes testable code
When automating a test, one must have these 3 finalities in mind.
We need to balance completeness, clarity and speed.

---

<h2 class="slide-title">Who automates the tests?</h2>

<h3 class="mt-5 fragment">Favour a <strong>whole team approach</strong></h3>

<p class="mb-none fragment">Developers and testers work together to</p>
<ul class="text-level-2">
  <li class="fragment">Build and maintain the test infrastructure</li>
  <li class="fragment">Design testable code</li>
  <li class="fragment">Write and maintain the automated tests</li>
</ul>

Notes:
- Build and maintain the test infrastructure -> requires the dev ops help
- Design testable code -> requires developers
- Write and maintain the automated tests -> requires developers
Any task might be completed by any team member
While a team can have automation experts, it doesn't limit particular tasks to particular team members
Everyone should feel responsible for the automated tests
**Without automated tests, we don't have a quality product.**

<h2 class="slide-title">Continuous Integration <br> / Continuous Delivery</h2>

<h3 class="mt-4 fragment">Run automated tests on each release</h3>

<p class="text-level-2 fragment">as part of your CI/CD pipeline</p>

<h3 class="fragment">Have a dedicated environment</h3>

<p class="text-level-2 fragment">A shared environment is not predictible</p>

Note:
On a shared environment, tests can fail for external reasons.
you must have clear control over the environment in which the tests run.



---

<h2 class="slide-title">You can't automate everything!</h2>

<p class="mt-6 fragment mb-none">Focus on:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">Critical paths and risk areas of your application</li>
  <li class="fragment">Parts that are hard to test manually</li>
</ul>


Notes:

- Risk areas include checkout, payemnts, etc.
- Hard to test manually:
  - complex setup (data, configuration...)
  - tests on multiple device
  - etc.

<h2 class="slide-title">Do I still need manual tests?</h2>

<div class="mt-6 fragment"><strong>YES!</strong></div>

## Good automated tests are F.I.R.S.T

<div class="mt-5 fragment">

- Fast
- Isolated
- Repeatable
- Small <!-- or Simple and Self-Verifying -->
- Timely

</div>

---

### Fast

<p class="fragment">The faster the test suite, the more offten it can run

<p class="fragment">Shortening the feedback loop accelerates the development process

<!-- cost of switching subject -->

---

### Isolated

<p class="fragment">Isolated tests can run in any order

<h3 class="fragment">Repeatable</h3>

<p class="fragment">Repeatable tests don't depend on the state of the environment in which they run

<p class="fragment apart">Without isolation and repeatability, you often get false positive. The biggest risk is too <strong>loose confidence in your tests</strong>.

Note: move the environment to a <strong>well-known state</strong> before they run

---

### Small

Avoid automating all UI end-to-end journeys. 

Write **atomic** scripts so that when they fail, you know why.

Note:
originaly: Simple and Self-Verifying
- Test must be easy to read
- The purpose of a test should be obvious
- Apply clean code practices (DRY, KISS, Single responsibility, solid ?)

---

### Timely

<p class="fragment">Try to automate tests before development

<div class="apart text-level-2">
<!--When written before development / Benefits -->
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">Production code is crafted so it's <strong>testable</strong>
  <li class="fragment">Tests are used to <strong>validate the changes</strong>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="apart text-level-2 fragment">Testing before development is more fun,<br> more beneficial, more productive, and less frustrating

<h2 class="slide-title">Never ignore failing tests</h2>

<p class="fragment">Fix flaky tests as soon as possible

<p class="fragment">If not fixed within a given time frame,<br> <strong>delete</strong> or <strong>quarantine</strong> the flaky test

### Make async APIs testable

<p class="text-level-2">Ask "what happens instead?" to prove that something does not happen</p>
