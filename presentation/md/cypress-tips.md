<h2 class="slide-title">Wait for events, not time</h2>


<h3 class="fragment">When can I verify the result of async operations?</h3>

```typescript
// bad
cy.wait(2000)  // wait for 2 seconds

// Good
cy.contains('Welcome')  // wait for the page to contain "welcome"

// Good
cy.intercept('POST', '/api/basket/add-product').as('addProductToBasket')
cy.get('button').contains('Add to basket').click()
cy.wait('@addProductToBasket')  // wait for a http response
```

Testing offten involves asynchronous behaviours.

<h2 class="slide-title">Minimize UI interactions</h2>


<p class="mt-5 fragment">Try to <strong>avoid the UI</strong> for all the parts of the tests <br> not dealing with <strong>UI-specific risks</strong>

<p class="mt-2 fragment">Setup your tests through <strong>api</strong>, <strong>db access</strong>...

<p class="mt-5 fragment">No UI set-up is <strong>faster</strong> and <strong>easier to maintain</strong>

Note:

From 50 quick ideas...
By avoiding the UI layer where it is not actually relevant for the purpose of the test, teams can save a lot of troubleshooting time and speed up feedback, while still keeping the same level of risk coverage.

Even when tests need to execute through the UI, minimise the part of the test that actually simulates user actions. Evaluate which parts of the tests are actually dealing with UI-specific risks, and try to automate everything else by avoiding the UI.

Set-up and clean-up tasks serve to make tests reliable and repeatable, but they do not actually deal with the user interface risk (or, more precisely, they should not â€“ if a set-up task is testing things, it should be broken into several tests).

<h2 class="slide-title">Never ignore failing tests</h2>

<p class="mt-6 fragment">Fix flaky tests as soon as possible

<p class="fragment">If not fixed within a given time frame,<br> <strong>quarantine</strong> or <strong>delete</strong> the flaky test

<p class="fragment">Don't let flaky tests attack your confidence!
